/**
 * Returns Item segments that shall be shown to a user as next recommendations when the user e.g. scrolls the page down (*infinite scroll*) or goes to the next page.
 * It accepts `recommId` of a base recommendation request (e.g., request from the first page) and the number of segments that shall be returned (`count`).
 * The base request can be one of:
 *   - [Recommend Item Segments to Item](https://docs.recombee.com/api#recommend-item-segments-to-item)
 *   - [Recommend Item Segments to User](https://docs.recombee.com/api#recommend-item-segments-to-user)
 *   - [Recommend Item Segments to Item Segment](https://docs.recombee.com/api#recommend-item-segments-to-item-segment)
 *   - [Search Item Segments](https://docs.recombee.com/api#search-item-segments)
 * All the other parameters are inherited from the base request.
 * *Recommend next Item segments* can be called many times for a single `recommId` and each call returns different (previously not recommended) segments.
 * The number of *Recommend next Item segments* calls performed so far is returned in the `numberNextRecommsCalls` field.
 * *Recommend next Item segments* can be requested up to 30 minutes after the base request or a previous *Recommend next Item segments* call.
 * For billing purposes, each call to *Recommend next Item segments* is counted as a separate recommendation request.
